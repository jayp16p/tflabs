# 🚨 Secret Key Alert: Not-So-Secret Anymore! 🚨

Hey, fellow code warriors! ⚔️

Just a heads-up: **The AWS secret keys in this repo are officially DOA**. They've been **revoked** faster than you can say "IAM policy" 🔒. If you were hoping to gain unauthorized access to my cloud, you're out of luck — those keys are as useful as a floppy disk in 2025. 🖥️💥

This repo is **public**, so while I’m all for sharing cool Terraform code with the world, **DO NOT** try to reuse any of these keys — they’re like expired API tokens: totally useless! 🙅‍♂️

Pro tip: If you need your own keys to play with, use your personal AWS credentials (or better yet, secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault) for anything sensitive. Your future self will thank you. 😉

Let’s keep things safe, secure, and free of credential leaks! 🛡️💻
